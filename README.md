# InfinadeckUnityPlugin
Unity plugin for implementation of Infinadeck features and assets.

Use this plugin in any desktop virtual reality project to translate outputs from the Infinadeck App to enable true 1:1 motion in your virtual reality project today!

This plugin was designed for use by anyone with access to an Infinadeck omnidirectional treadmill, or anyone who wants to create VR apps designed with the Infinadeck in mind.

Lightweight but feature-full, this simple-to-setup plugin should provide developers all of the tools they could possibly need to make a high-quality, Infinadeck-ready experience today.

-The central InfinadeckCore module loads and unloads other modules as necessary, to keep performance in the project as lightweight as possible.

-The critical InfinadeckLocomotion module provides the 1:1 motion mapping to your project, allowing for a no-hassle configuration-free translation between treadmill motion and in-game motion.

-The built-in InfinadeckReferenceObjects module allows you to see the treadmill in VR in real time, along with providing important grounding elements for maximum comfort in the VR space.

-The informative InfinadeckSplashscreen shows developers and players that their treadmill is working, allowing them to better verify their setup.

For advanced documentation, including implementation instructions and keyboard controls, please refer to the PDF located in the Infinadeck folder.
